                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Jerick Francis Mercado, a second-year student at LPU. My goal is to craft user-friendly experiences that prioritize both form and function. I have some experience in coding, including projects such as a GUI calculator and a flight reservation system, among others from my previous year.</p>
                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>PYTHON</li>
                    <li>Database Management (MySQL)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>Although I am still in the process of studying, I have gained some valuable experience through various projects. These include tasks assigned by my father, such as adjusting the design of his program, adding functions, and implementing loops. In school, I have also worked on activities like developing a GUI calculator, a fitness tracker, and coding using pycharm. I am continuously learning and gaining hands-on experience to further develop my skills. </p>
